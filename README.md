# MEDICARE-FRAUD-DETECTION

In the U.S., Medicare reimburses private providers for medical procedures performed for covered individuals. As such, it needs to verify that the type of procedures performed and the cost of those procedures are consistent and reasonable. Finally, it needs to detect possible errors or fraud in claims for reimbursement from providers. 
We have been hired to analyze a large amount of data from Medicare and try to detect abnormal data -- providers, areas, or patients with unusual procedures and/or claims.
The objective was to uncover anomalous patients, procedures, providers, and regions in the United States governmentâ€™s Medicare health insurance system.
